# RosenX (abandoned)

## Notice
Please note that I do not maintain RosenX anymore. While it is still possible to use it, TazSearch is a bit more refined (and it looks nicer).

## What is RosenX?
RosenX is an early attempt of mine to make a browser homepage. It uses searx.org for the search results, but you can replace this with your search engine of choice (e.g., Google, DuckDuckGo).
